Slice Definitions:

You have three slices defined: createTaskModalSliceFunc, updateTaskModalSliceFunc, and utilsSliceFunc. Each slice has an initial state and a set of reducer functions.
Reducers:

Reducers are functions that specify how the state changes in response to actions. Each reducer function takes the current state and an action as arguments and returns a new state. In your code, each reducer function is modifying the state by updating specific properties.
Actions:

Actions are payloads of information that send data from your application to your Redux store. In Redux Toolkit, actions are generated automatically by createSlice. You export action creators (openCreateTaskModal, closeCreateTaskModal, etc.) from each slice, which can be dispatched to update the state.
Store Configuration:

You use configureStore from Redux Toolkit to create a Redux store. You provide it with a reducer object that contains all the slices you've defined. Each slice becomes a slice of the store's state.
Provider and Store Integration:

Finally, you wrap your root component (App) with the Provider component from react-redux and pass the Redux store created above as a prop. This makes the Redux store available to all components in the application.
Overall, Redux Toolkit simplifies the process of managing Redux state by providing abstractions like createSlice and configureStore, reducing boilerplate and making the code more concise and maintainable.
